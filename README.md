## Street Fighter Ironhack Edition
### https://vomira.github.io/street-fighter/

For my first project I decided to take a small walk down memory lane and recreate the classic arcade game Street Fighter. 
Everything was done with the p5 library and plain HTML/CSS. There is also secret hidden moves!  

(**Hint**: it's 4 keys, for Chun Li it starts with S, T, F, ????. For Ryu it is L, Down, Right, ?????)

Enjoy the game and let me know what you think!
